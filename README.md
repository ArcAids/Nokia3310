Submission for Nokia jam2 in February 2020.

Theme: Death is good.
Restrictions: 84x48 resolution, monophonic sounds, only 2 colors to be used.

Game is a prototype of a summoning mechanic that seemed like stands from jojo bizzare adventures so I made it into a jojo gamme.

summoned Stand sacrifices itself to protect jojo over and over.

Its my first platformer game and I spent more time on level design and art than coding this time.

what I did: All Design(planning, level and gameplay). made all Sprites and, of course, programming.
